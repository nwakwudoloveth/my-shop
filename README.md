# My Shop (pre-owned item shop)
## This Project is a work in progress
### Capstone Project @ Coyotiv School of Software Engineering


> Have you ever bought things in the past which you no longer need? This could be as a result of changes in your preferences. What then becomes of the product in this case?  Do you dispose it? certainly not! You can resell it. Are you on the other hand not able to afford new products due to their high prices?
This web app seeks to enable users buy fairly used product or sell fairly (second- hand) products at cheaper prices. For the buyer it helps to reduce cost of purchase and enables the seller recover the cost of purchase and minimize loss.
